Platform Engineer Technical Assessment (Round 1)
Thank you for your interest in the Platform Engineer role at Eranova. To determine your fit for this role, Eranova has designed this technical assessment to evaluate your technical competencies. 
Evaluation Criteria: 
1.	Successful completion of technical scenario
2.	Clean, modular, OOP code and logical project structure and organization
3.	Ability to leverage components of the Generative AI stack and implement agentic workflows
4.	Ability to professionally present and walk through your project with an Eranova hiring manager
Scenario:
You are a Platform Engineer supporting an engagement with RetailCo: a national company which imports, purchases, and resells physical goods. RetailCo receives physical shipments from hundreds of vendors with a corresponding invoice. Each invoice includes line items with descriptions of the product, quantity purchased, and the price for each item. Due to the wide range of vendors and items, RetailCo must apply a specific tax rate based on each product’s tax category.
Currently, the RetailCo Accounts Payable team manually reviews all line items and assigns a relevant tax category and respective tax rate line-by-line. Since this is done manually and uses a significant amount of time and resources, RetailCo executives intend to replace this manual system with an agentic service to automatically match invoice line items and their product descriptions to product tax categories and corresponding tax rates.
Your task is to build and deploy a working service to ingest inbound invoices of varying form factors and calculate the applicable tax payable.
